This repository contains a guide to setup an Enterprise equavalent  Lightweight Kubernetes [k3s](https://k3s.io/) infra.
The guide is designed such that , someone with basic knowledge of Ubuntu , can setup the lab succesfully. Basic knowledge of Ubuntu only requires connecting, navigating and editing files .
As this is a work in progress I will continue to update and automate where possible to assist with the creation of the lab.
