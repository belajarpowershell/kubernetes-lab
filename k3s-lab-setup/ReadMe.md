# Kubernetes Lab Setup

This repository contains the relevant steps to setup

- 1 Alpine OS Management Server
- 1 single node  Lightweight Kubernetes ( k3s)
- 1 High Available Cluster Lightweight Kubernetes ( k3s)

The objective of this lab is to be able to rebuild the clusters very quickly as this is for testing services and applications. 

Files required for the setup can be extracted from the git repository  https://github.com/belajarpowershell/kubernetes-lab

The guide is designed such that , someone with basic knowledge of Ubuntu , can setup the lab succesfully. Basic knowledge of Ubuntu only requires connecting, navigating and editing files .

Follow the sequence number in the files , this will ensure that all the required services are setup.



Here is a high level on the tasks required .

Operating System Setup `100-alpine1`

- Clone the repository to the Hyper V host. (step `003-clone-repository`)
- Create the Virtual machines required using the PowerShell script. ( step `004-Hyper-V-VM-creation` )
- Setup Alpine Linux on VM `alpine1` .(step `100-alpine1-setup`)
- Connect to `alpine1` via ssh (step `101-ssh-to-alpine1` )
- Clone the repository on `alpine1` ( step 102-Clone-repository)
- Setup on `alpine1` the various services required . (step `103-setup-using-ansible`)
- Install Ubuntu OS on the remaining Virtual Machines ( loadbalancer,master1/2/3,worker1/2/3,singlenode) (step`113-generate-user-data-multipleVM` )

Lightweight [k3s](https://k3s.io/)  setup `200-kubernetes`
