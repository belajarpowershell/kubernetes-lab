# chmod +x download-srv.sh
# run the script
# ./download-srv.sh 

# This script will pull the specific folder/srv from the git repository and move the contents to the /srv on alpine1.


# initialize a new folder
git init kubernetes-lab
# change folder
cd kubernetes-lab
# add git repository to folder.

# enable sparsecheckout
git config core.sparsecheckout true
# specify folder to pull

# pull files locally.
git pull --depth=1 origin main

#create folder /srv if not already existing.
[ -d "/srv" ] || mkdir -p /srv && echo "Created /srv directory" || echo "/srv directory already exists"
