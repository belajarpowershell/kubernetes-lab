## Clone Repository on HyperV host.

Keep in mind this is to be run on the Windows PC where you are running Hyper-V. The git pull done on step `000-ReadMeFirst` was on `alpine1`

The files required can be downloaded from the Repository https://github.com/belajarpowershell/kubernetes-lab

You will need to have GIT installed [Install Git ](https://git-scm.com/download/win)



The following command will create a folder "kubernetes-lab"

```
# change to the Drive you want to store the files before executing this.
git clone https://github.com/belajarpowershell/kubernetes-lab.git
```



The files can then be found in ( in this example its the g:\ drive it might be different for you.)

```
g:\kubernetes-lab
```
