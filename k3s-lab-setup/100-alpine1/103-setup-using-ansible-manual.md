## Ansible to install `alpine1` services - manual.

Setting up the various services for automation is time consuming and possible prone to errors.

Using Ansible, I was able to reduce the time it too deploy the services required. 

Here we use the playbook with the several playbooks as below. 

 In `103-setup-using-ansible` the steps are combined and implemented in a single command. The individual steps will be helpful for troubleshooting or if there is a need to change selected configuration.



#### Ansible Playbook execution  

Change directory to `/srv/ansible/playbook-alpine1`

```
cd /srv/ansible/playbook-alpine1
```

Execute the playbook run from `/srv/ansible/playbook-alpine1`
