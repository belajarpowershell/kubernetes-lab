# `alpine1` setup and configuration.

## Install and Configure `nfs`

`nfs` functions as a remote Hard Disk. If you need to access files locally but are stored on a remote server shared using `nfs` then this `nfs` will behave as its a Hard Disk setup locally.

We do have use cases for `nfs` so lets set this up. 

```
#install nfs 
apk update
apk add nfs-utils

# set nfs to start at boot
rc-update add nfs

# check status
rc-service nfs status

#nfs configuration 
# update file with the entry below.
vi /etc/exports

/srv/isoubuntu 192.168.100.1/24(async,ro,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
/kubernetes-lab/kubernetes-lab-setup/srv/isoubuntu 192.168.100.1/24(async,ro,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
# refresh the nfs with the updated row.

exportfs -a -v 

#test mount using the following command
mkdir -p mntnfs
mount 192.168.100.1:/kubernetes-lab/kubernetes-lab-setup/srv/isoubuntu /mntnfs

# List files in mount
ls /mntnfs

```

### Setup `alpine1` `nfs` is complete.


## Next step

We will proceed with the tftp server installation
